# Virus game

A test project written to test nvgt

## how does the game work?

You are on A 15 tile strip, walking from left to right. There are virusses falling down. You have to shoot them before they hit the ground and make you loose A life. Controlls are as follows:

- left and right arrows: Move you left and right.
- up arrow: fire your weapon that makes A clicking sound when you shoot. In A menu, this moves you to the top and the down arrow does the same.
- A: check your accuracy in game.
- s: check your score in game.
- l: check your amount of lives.
- C: check your position.
- Escape: when ingame, takes you to the main menu and resets the game. If in the menu, quits the game.

I think that is all for now. If you want to contribute, feel free to make A PR and we can discuss some changes.
